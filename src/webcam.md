# Webcam Maintenance

## Set up

Get a laptop and ensure a webcam program is installed (recommended for linux: `cheese`)

Take a photo with a working webcam as a base to compare others to.

## Procedure

*Execution time*: a few seconds per camera.

Open a camera program (if you're using `cheese` you'll need to press the camera swap button 
in the bottom left the first time to change the input from your laptop camera)

Now plug in the test camera and check that it is relatively close to the base image.

## Things to check for:
- Focus of camera is similar to the base.
- Exposure is similar to the base image.
- Exposure adapts to low light (cover it with your hand).

Don't worry about the saturation/colour temperature differences for of the image, our vision
system converts the outputs to black and white.
